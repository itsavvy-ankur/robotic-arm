# A Pick-N-Place Robotic Arm

This repository is a salvage of code / documents from my final year project as part of M.Sc.IT which was implemented during my coursework from ~August 2007 to March 2008.

## High Level Overview and Scope
* Eletrical design and build of the components to integrate with PC Parallel port
* Design and build of the robot strucuture 
* Design and programming of the Java application consisting of :
  * Integration with PC's LPT(Parallel) port using Java Native Interface(JNI) and INPOUT32.dll
  * Integration of a Video feed from a stationary webcam to capture field of view using Java Multimedia API
  * Ability to control different arms using the Java app using different stepping modes(including high torque operation)
